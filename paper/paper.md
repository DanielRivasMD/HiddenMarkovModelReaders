# Summary

Data and signal processing is a demanding task that calls for novel and efficient methodology. 

Unsupervised hypothesis generation and learning offers tremendous value due to its scalability nature.



# Statement of need

HiddenReaders is a Julia implementation of hidden Markov model and hypothesis generation for signal processing. It provides a convinient API to create a hidden Markov model and update its state as well as collect the traceback.

Using Parameters, the user can have control over the parameters of the model conviniently.

Thanks to Julia's just-in-time (JIT) LLVM compiler (REF) and efficinet artificial intelligence implementation, e.g., Flux [@Innes:2018], HiddenReaders can be easily incorporated into data processing pipelines.
