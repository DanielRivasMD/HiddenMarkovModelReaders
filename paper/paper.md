# Summary

Data and signal processing is a demanding task that calls for novel and efficient methodology. 

Unsupervised hypothesis generation and learning from data directly offers a tremendous value due to its scalability nature. Furthermore, unlike for supervised learning, no labeled data is required.



# Statement of need

HiddenReaders is a Julia implementation of a Hidden Markov model combined with a Hypothesis Generator. While its initial purpose was to find repeteated patterns in the one-dimensional time-domain, such as EEGs, EKGs, audio, or Internet traffic data, the method is also applicable for discrete time series, and potentially multi-dimensional data streams, such as videos or surveillance. Hidden Reader's implementation provides a convinient API to create a hidden Markov model and update its state as well as collect the traceback.

Using Parameters, the user can control all of the parameters of the model in a user friendly way.

We selected Julia as the language for implementation, both due to Julia's just-in-time (JIT) LLVM compiler (REF) and efficinet artificial intelligence implementation, e.g., Flux [@Innes:2018], as well as due to Julia's user friendliness. As such, HiddenReaders can be easily incorporated into any data processing pipelines. 


# Introduction
Hidden Markov Models[1] were invented in the 1960's for solving the problem of back-tracing the inner mechanisms of processes that could not be observed directly.
